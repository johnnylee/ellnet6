EllNet ("Ell" for "L" for "Local") is a simple, pure-python  network 
framework for creating client-server applications using the IPv6 link-
local address space. 

The ellnet.py file contains the main class, EllNetBaseServer, which 
has code for sending an receiving local broadcast packets, and 
handling requests. It also contains some utility functions for 
sending and receiving blocks of data. 

The file fileserver.py contains a simple read-only file sharing 
example program taking advantage of the features of EllNetBaseServer. 

The script ellnetfs relies on the python fuse bindings. These allow 
the creation of user-space file systems. The file system displays 
directories shared by other machines in the link-local address space
using the fileserver.FileServer object. It is used as follows:

On machine A we want to share the directory ~/media, and we want to 
be known as "machineA" to others on the network. We want other's 
shares to appear in ~/shared. If our network device is wlan0, we 
would run ellnetfs as:
    
    ellnetfs wlan0 machineA ~/media ~/shared

Or to run in the foreground and see debug messages:
 
    ellnetfs wlan0 machineA ~/media -f ~/shared

On a machine B we would do something similar (using the appropriate 
interface and directories):

    ellnetfs wlan1 machineB ~/my_shared_files ~/shared

As long as the machines are in the same IPv6 network segment, they 
should see each other's shared files. 

Now when machineB (a laptop, for example) comes online, it's shared 
directory will appear on machineA in ~/shared/machineB/ and vice 
versa.
